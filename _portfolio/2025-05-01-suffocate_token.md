**Suffocate (Token)** is a digital extension of the *Watch Me Suffocate* metal band project. It focuses on distributing selected tracks, artwork, and related materials through a token-based system.

The project includes self-produced music and visual assets. All content is managed independently and made available via a dedicated platform for listening and download.

Source code and documentation are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/watchmesuffocate). Token access is available at [Token](https://token.watchmesuffocate.com).
