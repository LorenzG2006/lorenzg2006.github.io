**mo-tion next** is a forward-looking roadmap for the mo-tion platform ecosystem. It outlines a clear vision for where the platform is headed - from smarter automation and more efficient operator workflows to more scalable content pipelines for live events and multimedia productions.

While AI and machine learning can be part of that future, **mo-tion next** primarily communicates the bigger picture: the direction, priorities, and product vision behind the mo-tion ecosystem.

More information can be found on the official [mo-tion next](https://next.geyser.at).
