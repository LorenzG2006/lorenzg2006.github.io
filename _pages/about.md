I'm Lorenz Geyser, an IT professional from Austria.

## About Me
Born in 2006 and based in Vienna, I have a strong passion for information technology and the digital world in general. Whether it's exploring new programming languages, understanding system architectures, or diving into the latest tech trends â€” I'm always eager to learn and expand my knowledge.

Living in Vienna gives me access to a vibrant tech community and excellent educational opportunities, which continue to fuel my interest in technology. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and solve problems through code and innovation.

## My Work
I'm currently working at [mo-tion](https://mo-tion.at), an event company based in Vienna that specializes in interactive presentations, mappings, and real-time sports graphics. This role gives me hands-on experience in the event technology sector, where I help create engaging visual experiences and support innovative multimedia productions for a variety of events.

## Background
I attended primary school in Korneuburg, followed by lower secondary education at AHS Korneuburg. I later completed my studies at HTL Hollabrunn with a focus on Information Technology. This educational path has provided me with a strong foundation in both general academics and specialized IT knowledge.
